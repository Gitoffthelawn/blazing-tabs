Blazing Tabs - a blazing fast tab switcher
</h1>

Blazing Tabs is a browser extension that allows you to search and switch your tabs blazingly fast.

It is available for

- Firefox [extension in addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/blazing-tabs/)
- Google Chrome [extension in chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blazing-tabs/kapombfhjmjcjonlbcibhekfnjkjjaip)

![demo video](https://github.com/smatting/blazing-tabs/raw/main/assets/workflow-demo.gif)

Features:

- Allows for keyboard-only workflow:
    1. Ctrl+E to open the search (Cmd+E on mac)
    2. Type to search and use arrow keys to select tab
    3. Hit ENTER to switch to tab, or Ctrl+Left to close the tab
- Incremental multi-keyword search. Both the tab's title and domain are searched.
    
Blazing Tabs is especially useful if you've got so many tabs open that you can't barely read their titles anymore.

Blazing Tabs works completely offline. Your data never leaves your browser.

## How to build

Prerequisites: Install [nix](https://nixos.org/). The `shell.nix` pins all the build tools needed to build.

1. Start a nix-shell `nix-shell`. In this shell [spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago) etc are available that can build the app.
2. Inside the nix shell run `./scripts/make.sh` to compile all Purescript code to `src/index.js`
3. Inside the nix shell run `./scripts/package.sh` to create a browser extension zip file in `dist/`.

## How to develop

1. Start a nix-shell `nix-shell`
2. `./scripts/dev.sh`
3. (Re)load the browser extension `src/`. Alternatively open `debug-ui/index.html` to test the app with dummy tabs.
